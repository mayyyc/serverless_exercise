# serverless_exercise

- A narrative of the approach taken

I have not done serverless or any backend dev for a long time so I followed this tutorial https://www.serverless.com/blog/node-rest-api-with-serverless-lambda-and-dynamodb and I managed to create a database and add function to add an item in database.

Then I thought I should first try import the json file into the database so I can do the search function so I followed this tutorial but couldnâ€™t get it work https://cloudquest.medium.com/how-to-bulk-insert-json-into-dynamodb-6f3b67020abd

- What principles did you apply?
  I had no idea how to do this so I just googled how to do a serverless api, tried copy and paste some code and there were some errors then I googled the errors and managed to fix them and then other errors came up and I run out of time :)
